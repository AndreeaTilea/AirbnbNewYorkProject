# AirbnbNewYorkProject  
Cleaned and analyzed the data that contained Airbnb listings from New York. 
Found that Manhattan was the most popular neighbourhood where people get Airbnb's. 
Entire/room apartment was more popluar than the other room options.
Based on the NeighbourHood Staten Island tends to have the most availabilty. 
The room type correlates with the price.
